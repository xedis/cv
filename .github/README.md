## About

The resume content is defined in [`resume.yml`](/resume.yml) following the [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/) standard, and validated against [`schema.json`](/schema.json).
A LaTex document is then generated from [`template.jinja`](/template.jinja) formated with [`resume-format.cls`](/tex/resume-format.cls), which is then compiled into a PDF by GitHub Actions, and published under the [Releases](https://github.com/Lissy93/cv/releases) tab.
A markdown version is also generated by [`lib/markdown.py`](/lib/markdown.py), as well as a CV website which is built as a static Svelte site and deployed to GitHub Pages at [cv.xedis.net](https://xedis.net).<br>
...Because why spend 30 minutes writing your CV, when you could spend 30 hours automating it? Or maybe spend 15 hrs learning typescript and github actions while piggybacking onto another developers awesomeness?? -xedis

## Usage

### Option #1 - GitHub
Upon creating a tag (by triggering the [Tag Workflow](/.github/workflows/tag.yml)), a new Release will be drafted with your compiled CV PDF attatched

1. Fork the repo
2. Update resume.json with your own content
3. Trigger the GitHub Action to compile the PDF


<details><summary>Workflows</summary>

- `tag` - Creates a new Git tag. Optionally specify the tag name and description, or by default it will just bump the sem ver patch number by 1
- `generate` - Generates your resume in PDF form as an artifact. If triggered by a tag, then a new release will be created, with the PDF attatched
- `validate` - Validates your resume data against the schema. This will also run whenever a new PR is opened, to ensure it's valid and working 
</details>

### Option #2 - Local
See the [`Makefile`](/Makefile) for all the available commands. Or, just run `make` from the root, to install deps, validate content, generate LaTex, and compile PDF

1. Clone the repo
2. Update resume.json with your own content
3. Run `make` from the root, to install deps, validate content, generate LaTex, and compile PDF

<details><summary>Commands</summary>

- `make install` - Download dependencies
- `make validate` - Validate content
- `make generate` - Generate LaTex
- `make compile` - Compile PDF
- `make clean` - Remove generated files
- `make watch` - Watch for changes, recompile and refresh
- `make web` - Launches web version, installs NPM deps, builds and serves the site
</details>

### Editing
Modify data by editing [`resume.yml`](/resume.yml)<br>
If you need to customize the layout, edit [`template.jinja`](/template.jinja)<br>
Or to change the styles and formatting, edit [`resume-format.cls`](/tex/resume-format.cls)<br>
All the scripts used to generate output are located in [`lib/`](/lib/)<br>
These are triggered either by the [`Makefile`](/Makefile) or via GitHub Actions with the [`workflows/`](/.github/workflows)<br>
The source for the website version is located in [`web/`](/web)
